## Backstory

Amber grew up in Mirabar training to become a miner, however, she felt uncomfortable with live there.
She never felt like she fit in, lke she was different from the other dwarves and that they didn't really accept her.

At the young age of 60, she left Mirabar and spent the next 20 years travelling the area, trying to discover who she was.
She learned of the Lathander, God of Birth and Renewal, and transformed into the woman she is now.

At 80 she came to Waterdeep, and settled down as an Acolyte at a temple to Lathander,
hoping to help others who might be lost in their own ways to find themselves.

A hundred years have past, and Amber still feels she is missing something.
She's never had close friends, let alone anything more.
Now she's ready to head out and meet new people, and help the lost who have yet to hear of Lathander.
